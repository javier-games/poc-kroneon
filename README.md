# Króneon

Embark on a thought-provoking puzzle-adventure as Li, who must save his beloved grandfather from unknown creatures. 
To succeed, solve puzzles by time traveling through the mysterious 'fridge', which allows you to experience the world 
from different perspectives.

# Development

Króneon was conceptualized and created of the [LEIVA](https://leiva.cenart.gob.mx/) program at the National Center of
Arts. LEIVA, the Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Experimentation and Innovation with Video Games and Interactive Art,
is a collaborative space that explores new narrative, aesthetic, and technological possibilities in gaming.

The game was [exhibited](https://leiva2017.wordpress.com/actividades/muestra-de-proyectos-leiva-2017/) from August 24 
to September 3, 2017, at the Manuel Felguérez Gallery, National Center of Arts, Mexico City.

# Features

## Challenging Puzzles

Solve intricate puzzles activating switches, and navigating through doors within a limited timeframe.

## Time Travel Mechanic

Each level has a limited number of time travels available. To initiate time travel, the player must wait for the time 
machine (represented as an old fridge) to charge. Once the machine is fully charged, the player's position is stored,
and any movements made afterward are recorded. By pressing the space button, the player can then create a clone that
repeats the recorded routine, helping them solve puzzles by collaborating with their past self.

## Paradox-Free Interaction

Strategically plan your moves, as Li cannot see his other selves without causing a paradox. To avoid this, characters 
can detect the presence of other characters in front of them, allowing you to navigate and solve puzzles without 
direct visual contact between clones.
